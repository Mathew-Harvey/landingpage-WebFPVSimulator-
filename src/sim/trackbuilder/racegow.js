/*
 * racegow.js: the RaceGOW track specification, as numbers.
 *
 * WHAT RACEGOW IS, because the shape of it decides the shape of this file.
 * It is not a race league with heats and marshals. It is an asynchronous, at
 * home, video verified TIME TRIAL series run by Dan "FPV Skittles" Sugano,
 * the whoop sized version of MultiGP's Universal Time Trial: eight tracks a
 * season, one every fortnight, each published as a DIMENSIONED SPEC that
 * every pilot builds in their own living room out of 3/4 inch PVC and flies
 * alone. The metric is the fastest THREE CONSECUTIVE LAPS, always starting
 * and finishing on one designated gate.
 *
 * That is why a simulator can clone it honestly: the track is a spec, not a
 * place. Everybody flies the same geometry, and the times pool on one board.
 * It is the same loop this project already has.
 *
 * SOURCES. Every number below is quoted from RaceGOW's own published rules
 * or from the on screen dimension cards in the official build videos:
 *
 *   "RaceGOW Track Building Rules and Information"
 *     docs.google.com/document/d/1RDksQXnRSFZk1Xtg7ERQPjo_-OQ_DxJzZDR5UEtFjFY
 *   "RaceGOW Basic Concept and Classes"
 *     docs.google.com/document/d/1gVuj5Sy9m8SGn5isr9FQF6-FF4EzGyM9rJYqjwrTwJM
 *   "RaceGOW General Rules"
 *     docs.google.com/document/d/16ib_NF-k4bQZlHipQ_DtycPLboodA9TFNLXR6_CBQfQ
 *   the Track Diagram cards in youtube.com/watch?v=IZVy-fwQVjE
 *   the per track diagrams, e.g. RaceGOW Track8 and Track6
 *
 * The metric figures are RaceGOW's own where they published one, and the
 * exact conversion of their imperial figure where they did not. Where a
 * number here is DERIVED rather than quoted, it says so.
 *
 * This file has no DOM and no Three.js and imports nothing from the
 * simulator, exactly like the rest of the builder's data modules, so
 * src/game/trackdoc.js can read it too.

 * for 99 cents each" (RaceGOW, twice). 3/4 inch nominal schedule 40 PVC has
 * an outside diameter of 1.050 in, which is 26.7 mm. RaceGOW does not
 * mandate a diameter, only the gate geometry, and European builders use
 * 20 mm; 3/4 inch is what the organiser's own tracks are built from and what
 * the diagrams are drawn against.
 *
 * The section length is the load bearing number and it is quoted exactly:
 * "If you cut your 20 PVC sections between 26.5" (67.31cm) and 27.25"
 * (69.22cm) then when you assemble adjacent gates you will have the maximum
 * allowable open area and the minimum allowable center to center distance
 * between gates." One length builds every element on the track.

 * THE GATE RULES, verbatim in the comments, exact in the numbers.
 *
 * 1. "All gates must have an open area the size of a 28" (71cm) square or
 *    anything that would fit inside a 28" square."
 * 2. "All gates must be fully enclosed. This means when using PVC you must
 *    have a section along the ground of each gate. If you are creating gates
 *    then the floor, wall, and/or ceiling cannot act as a side of a gate."
 *    THIS IS WHY EVERY MICRO GATE HAS A BAR ON THE FLOOR and why the default
 *    sill height is zero rather than the six inches rule 4 would allow.
 * 3. "All adjacent gates must be between 27" (68.58cm) minimum and 33"
 *    (83.82cm) maximum from center to center of the gates. ... This rule
 *    applies to both side by side and vertically stacked gates." The Track
 *    Diagram cards give the nominal as 30" plus or minus 3".
 * 4. "Gates on the 'ground' have their center at 20" (50.8cm) or lower above
 *    the ground. This means a full size gate can be a MAXIMUM of 6" (15cm)
 *    above the ground."
 * 5. "The top gate on a two high stack of gates must be AT LEAST 42"
 *    (106.7cm) above the ground. A 3rd gate stacked on top would need to be
 *    AT LEAST 69" (175.3cm) above the ground."
 *
 * And from the season doc: a minimum gate size of 24", "no maximum size but
 * all your gates must be the same size. You must scale the entire track up
 * equally based on your gate size."

/*
 * THE ROOM, which RaceGOW does not specify and which a simulator has to.
 *
 * Pilots need run off: the RaceGOW3 Track 7 leaderboard carries the note
 * "Can we quit with the tracks that go out of the bounds on all 4 sides?",
 * and the rules themselves say "you will need some additional space around
 * the outside of that to fly the tracks optimally". A metre and a bit on
 * every side of the envelope is what the organiser's own footage shows.
 *
 * IT WAS 5 BY 6 BY 2.4 M, A DOMESTIC ROOM, AND IT IS NOW A HALL. The owner
 * flew it and asked for twice the room and a higher ceiling, which is a
 * judgement about how a whoop reads on screen rather than about RaceGOW: at
 * 5 by 6 the aircraft is never more than two and a half metres from a wall,
 * so almost every input is a correction and the pilot spends the lap
 * defending the boundary instead of flying the track. RaceGOW itself does
 * not specify the room, only the envelope and that pilots "will need some
 * additional space around the outside of that", so a bigger space is inside
 * the spec rather than a departure from it: the RaceGOW3 Track 7 leaderboard
 * carries the note "Can we quit with the tracks that go out of the bounds on
 * all 4 sides?", which is a field complaining about too little run off, not
 * too much.
 *
 * 10 by 12 m with a 4 m ceiling is a sports hall, a shed or a warehouse bay,
 * which is where organised whoop racing is actually flown once it leaves the
 * living room. It holds a 28 inch track with 4.3 m of run off on the short
 * sides and 4.9 m on the long ones.
 *
 * The ceiling matters more than the floor and that is why it moved too. A
 * triple stack's top gate centre is at 1.88 m and the Elevated Gate rule
 * pushes an opening to 2.13 m, so a 2.4 m domestic ceiling left 270 mm of
 * air over the tallest legal element: a pilot who ballooned over an elevated
 * gate hit the joists. At 4 m there is nearly 1.9 m of it, which is room to
 * make the mistake and recover from it.

 *

 * would make the rule the author's problem instead of the tool's.
 * `horizontalPole` exists because there is no existing element that is a
