/*
 * cars.js: every car in the freestyle worlds, drawn in the town's cel look.
 *
 * ONE MODEL, THREE CALLERS. The town's own parked cars (the vendored
 * world/traffic.js parks them with makeVehicle, which hands the drawing to
 * townVehicle here through the hook in PATCH-world-vehicles.diff, and the
 * kei trucks through PATCH-world-props.diff), a built map's parked car
 * (src/props/kit.js town('car')) and a built map's moving car (src/maps/
 * built/cars.js) all come out of buildCar, so a kei van in a yard is the kei
 * van outside the conbini and the drift car is the same car parked or
 * sliding. The vendored builders keep their tables and their placement;
 * only the drawing moved, into this file, which is ours and GPLv3, so an
 * upstream update of the town is a re-copy plus two small patches.
 *
 * THE DIMENSIONS ARE THE TOWN'S, TO THE CENTIMETRE, BECAUSE THEY ARE
 * PHYSICS. L, W, R, the axles, sill, waist, roof, cab, the rakes and the box
 * lorry's box come from the vendored SPEC table itself (imported, not
 * copied), which is what the town's colliders (vehicleSize) and the built
 * map's solids and moving boxes (CAR_KINDS in src/props/street.js, VEHICLE_
 * KINDS in src/maps/built/traffic.js) are sized from. What this file adds
 * is SHAPE, never size: the side profile, the arches, the glasshouse's
 * tumblehome, the lamps, the glass, the wheels. The drawn body is built
 * round the solid boxes, not inside them: a flank is on the box's face, a
 * bumper stands out past L / 2 as the vendored bumper bar did, and where a
 * chamfer rounds an edge the solid's corner is at most about 3 cm outside
 * the paint (the shoulder, the roof edge; 5 cm at the top of the steepest
 * noses). The kei truck keeps makeKeiTruck's own sizes, which is what its
 * collider was written from. The r32 is new, and its numbers are the real
 * coupe's: 4.50 by 1.76 by 1.34 m, a 2.615 m wheelbase.
 *
 * HOW A BODY IS MADE. Two bevelled prisms and what is laid on them. The
 * lower body is the car's side profile (bumpers, bonnet, the waist under
 * the glasshouse, the boot or tailgate, and the two wheel arches cut out of
 * its lower edge) extruded across the car with a chamfer round both flanks,
 * deeper at the four plan corners, which is what turns a slab into a car in
 * the cel ramp: the chamfer takes its own band of light, so a white car has
 * a pale rim along its shoulder and a violet one under its sill, and the
 * screen space ink finds a crease there to draw. The glasshouse is a second
 * prism on the waist, narrower than the body by a shoulder and narrowing
 * again to the roof (the tumblehome). Glass, lamps, grilles, shut lines,
 * handles, mirrors and wheels are laid ON those faces, a few millimetres
 * proud, never inside them (the town's rule: depth is built outward).
 *
 * THE ART'S RULES, the town's. Materials are the vendored cel() and flat()
 * with the town's ramps and violet shadow tints, in the looks the vendored
 * cars already used, so the town's bake folds a car into the batches its
 * neighbours are in and a new car costs triangles, not draw calls. Glass is
 * the palette's dark glass with a pale streak or two across it, the way an
 * animator paints a windscreen. The lamps are the two colours the vendored
 * builder lit a car with (LAMP_FRONT, LAMP_REAR), because src/props/kit.js
 * and src/maps/built/cars.js find the lamps by them to keep them lit at
 * dusk. No badge, no maker's name, no model name anywhere: a car in the
 * art style, recognisable from its shapes.
 *
 * TWO LEVELS OF DETAIL. 'parked' (every parked car, the town's and a built
 * map's) draws the wheels at 12 sides with their outer faces only and
 * keeps a car within the vendored model's triangle count; 'full' (the
 * moving cars, a handful on a map) draws 16 sided wheels with both faces
 * and the rim's dish. A moving car's wheels are not in the body at all:
 * src/maps/built/cars.js draws them from carWheelGeometry as instances.
 *
 * THE CONVENTION, the vendored one: nose along +x, origin at ground level in
 * the middle of the footprint, y up; `ry` turns the nose to (cos ry, 0,
 * -sin ry). Render only: nothing here reaches the physics, which reads the
 * tables and never a mesh, so Math.sin and Math.cos are used freely.
