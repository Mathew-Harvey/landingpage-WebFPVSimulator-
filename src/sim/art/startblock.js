/*
 * startblock.js: the launch stand a 5 inch race actually uses.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. A MultiGP start block is not a floor tile. It is a small
 * wooden (or powder coated aluminium) stand with TWO PARALLEL RAILS, a gap
 * down the middle for the battery, foam on the rails so the front arms
 * grip, and a lip at the low end so the craft does not slide off when the
 * pilot pitches it forward. GetFPV's DIY writeup is the n-shaped timber
 * version (two 25 cm rails, about 9 cm apart, foam on top). The printed
 * "start block" stands add a 25 to 30 degree tilt and triangular side
 * plates. This mesh is that object: a plywood base, two wedge cheeks, two
 * foam-topped rails on the slope, a rear brace, and a front lip.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SHARED AND WHY IT LIVES HERE. src/render/scene.js dresses the
 * world with it and src/trackbuilder/view3d.js dresses the author's preview
 * with it, so a stand on the field and a stand in the builder are the same
 * shape. The builder is not allowed to import the simulator, so the mesh
 * cannot live in src/render. It is not a course dimension (those stay in
 * elements.js as pads, spacing, padSize) and it is not the game: it is the
 * art both of them draw from.
 *
 * LOCAL FRAME, Y up, matching Three.js. +X is across the start line, +Y is
 * up, +Z is toward the spawn (behind the line). The low end of the ramp is
 * -Z, which is the way the quad sets off. Callers that live in a Z-up
 * document rotate the returned group once; they do not rebuild the parts.
 *
 * THREE.JS IS PASSED IN. view3d.js loads Three lazily so a dead CDN cannot
 * take the 2D authoring view down with it. This file must not import three.

 * The stand's own sizes, scaled so a default 0.6 m pad footprint still

/*
 * THE FLOOR CAME DOWN FROM 0.4 TO 0.15 FOR THE WHOOP.
 *
 * 0.4 is not a mesh safety limit, it is the note above this: a stand at real
 * timber sizes disappears into the grass at the third person camera, so the
 * smallest one ever DRAWN was kept legible. That reasoning is about a 60 m
 * field and a camera four metres behind a quad that sweeps 0.35 m.
 *
 * A RaceGOW start pad is 0.10 m, which under the old floor came out at 0.4
 * and therefore 0.152 m of rail: a launch stand twice as long as the whole
 * aircraft, on a floor where the camera is two hundred millimetres away.
 * The legibility argument runs the other way at that distance. 0.15 lets a
 * 0.10 m pad ask for what it is, about 63 mm of rail, which is a real foam
 * launch pad and is the same size as the machine standing on it.

 * 1 ms step and samples the slope through it five more times per pass.
 * startBlockDims computes rise with Math.tan and slopeLen with Math.cos,
 * and CLAUDE.md says in as many words that no JS Math.sin, Math.cos or
 * Math.pow may appear anywhere in the physics path, because they are not
 * specified to bit precision and vary between engines. A start block was
 * putting Math.tan into the trajectory a thousand times a second, and the
 * same trace on two browsers was not guaranteed to match.
 *
 * So the trig runs ONCE, when the stand is placed, and this is what comes
 * out. Callers hold the result and hand it back; nothing here is
 * recomputed per query.
