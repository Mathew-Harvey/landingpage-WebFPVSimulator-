/*
 * wallart-hang.js: where the whoop room's posters and banners hang, and the
 * quads and rods that hang them. Geometry only.
 *
 * HANGING is the whole of the design decision about where, and it used to
 * live in ./wallart.js with the rest. It is here, on its own, because the
 * front door draws the same room in its whoop act and has to hang the same
 * art in the same places, and ./wallart.js cannot go there: it lights the
 * art with ../render/celmat.js, and the front door has its own port of that
 * file, which patches the same three.js shader chunk at import. Two patches
 * of one chunk is one too many, so the front door copies this module and
 * the atlas table, and lights the art with its own port. Nothing in this
 * file makes a material, fetches a picture or knows about a layer, which is
 * what lets it be shared. See the front door's src/room.js.
