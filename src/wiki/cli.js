    lab: `In compiled pid.c the P term is Kp times (setpoint minus filtered gyro) on the ${a.axis} axis, in firmware units, not SI. The output is mixed onto the ${a.axis} mixer column. P does not remember; a constant disturbance (nose-up at speed, motor cant) is I's job.`,
    sim: `LIVE. Writes pidProfiles(0)->pid[PID_${a.Axis.toUpperCase()}].P. The plant never reads this number. It only sees motor duty after mixTable.`,
    upAir: `${a.Axis} starts sooner. Small moves on ${a.stick} feel more connected. Past a point the craft buzzes, especially on punch when the gyro hash is loud.`,
    upLab: `Higher Kp raises closed-loop bandwidth and shrinks tracking lag. It also amplifies whatever noise survived the gyro filter. Damping ratio falls; the D term has to work harder. On yaw, extra P is often cheaper than extra D because yaw D is noisy.`,
    downAir: `${a.Axis} feels soft and late. You wait for the craft, then you over-move the stick.`,

    lab: `Integral of error, with itermLimit, iterm_windup, iterm_relax and iterm_rotation all LIVE and able to stop or rotate that accumulator. Anti-gravity boosts I during fast throttle changes so a punch does not bow. A constant plant couple (H-force above the CG on pitch) is exactly what this term exists to cancel.`,
    sim: `LIVE. Writes the I gain on PID_${a.Axis.toUpperCase()}. The cant table's hover yaw bias is a worked example: I trims it, as a real machine would.`,
    upAir: `${a.Axis} holds a line better and fights the nose-up or drift you would otherwise hold out of. Too much and the craft lurches when you stop a flip, unless relax is doing its job.`,
    upLab: `Higher Ki reduces steady-state rate error and winds faster. The unwind is the danger: a large accumulator dumped into the mixer is a twitch. Relax, windup percent and the limit exist to bound that.`,
    downAir: `You will hold a little ${a.axis} trim forever. Fast moves may still look fine because P and F handle those.`,

    lab: `Kd times a filtered derivative of gyro, not of error, so a clean stick move is not punished. d_min_* (D max in the UI) can keep a low hover D and raise D when the stick slams. TPA often attenuates D at high throttle. Yaw D is frequently low on real 5 inches.`,
    sim: `LIVE. Gyro hash in bf_glue.c is why this gain is not free here. If you raise D and the craft buzzes on punch, cut less filter than you think, or you will take a tune that only works in a browser.`,
    upAir: `Stops ${a.motion} more cleanly. Too much is a grinding buzz you can hear in the motors and see in the picture.`,
    upLab: `Adds damping to the rate loop and gain at high frequency. Past the phase margin the axis oscillates at a few tens of hertz, which the D filter then either hides or feeds.`,
    downAir: `${a.Axis} overshoots a stop and feels bouncy. Snap-back when you centre the stick.`,
